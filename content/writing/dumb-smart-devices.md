# Smart devices should still function as dumb devices

I recurringly get frustrated that I can't manually set the date and time on my [Pebble Time Smartwatch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises).
The only way to change the time for this watch is to connect it to your phone via blutooth and the Pebble app.
Unfortunately, support never lasts forever and Pebble discontinued it's app and removed it from the iPhone and Android stores.
So the only option I had for changing the time on my watch is to boot up my old Android phone, download the community maintained
[Rebble](https://rebble.io/) app for the watch, and reconnect my watch to my android phone.

This device is a smartwatch and it can do lots of amazing things, but at its core it should still at least function as a watch.
