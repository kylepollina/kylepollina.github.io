# Ass logic

Whenever doing something you can either half-ass it or whole-ass it. Half-assing something is
really tempting because you save yourself one half-ass worth of time in the short term to spend
doing something else. However, when you half-ass something, then it is more likely that something
breaks and then your ass is in the grass.

The problem is that it doesn't necessarily take another half-ass to fix the problem. Usually it
is a whole-ass load of work to fix the problem because you have to clean up the mess and re-do what
you half-assed before. So all in all, half assing something now will most likely cost you one and a
half asses in total work.

On the other hand you can whole-ass the work now and put a lot of effort into making sure your
something won't break and you end up saving your own ass in the future.
