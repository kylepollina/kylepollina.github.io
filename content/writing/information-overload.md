# Information overload

Information is a drug and causes addict-like behavior in humans.
I haven't quite figured out why, but I crave information. Too much
information can cause information overload and information overload
is like a drug overdose. I am currently experiencing this drug overdose
and I need to cut out parts of my life that cause this.

Hackernews is first, I've learned great things from there but farewell for now,
I need my focus back. I need my boredom back too.
