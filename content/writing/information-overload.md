# Information overload

Information is a drug and causes addict-like behavior in us.
I haven't quite figured out why, but I crave information. Too much
information can cause information overload and information overload
is like a drug overdose. I am currently experiencing this drug overdose
and I need to cut out the parts of my life that cause this.

I need my focus back. I need my boredom back too.
